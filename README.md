# Functional Koans


### Getting Started

The only things you need to run the Clojure Koans are:

- JRE 1.5 or higher
- clojure-1.2.0.jar
  (http://github.com/downloads/relevance/functional-koans/clojure-1.2.0.jar)

clojure-1.2.0.jar needs to be placed in a directory `lib` under this project.

You can also use leiningen (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) to
automatically install the clojure-1.2.0.jar in the right place.

After you have leiningen installed, run

`lein deps`

which will download all dependencies you need to run the clojure koans.


### Running The Koans

To run the koans, simply run

`./run.sh`

or, on Windows,

`run.bat`
