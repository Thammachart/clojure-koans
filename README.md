# Functional Koans


### Getting Started

The only things you need to run the Clojure Koans are:

- JRE 1.5 or higher
- clojure-1.3.0-alpha1.jar

clojure-1.3.0-alpha1.jar needs to be placed in a directory `lib` under this
project.

You can use Leiningen (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) to
automatically install the Clojure jar in the right place.

After you have leiningen installed, run

`lein deps`

which will download all dependencies you need to run the clojure koans.


### Running The Koans

To run the koans, simply run

`run.sh`

or, on Windows,

`run.bat`
