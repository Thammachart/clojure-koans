# Clojure Koans

The Clojure Koans are a fun and easy way to get started with Clojure - no
experience assumed or required.  Just follow the instructions below to start
making tests pass!


### Getting Started

The only things you need to run the Clojure Koans are:

- JRE 1.5 or higher
- clojure-1.3.0-alpha1.jar

clojure-1.3.0-alpha1.jar needs to be placed in a directory `lib` under this
project.

You can use Leiningen (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) to
automatically install the Clojure jar in the right place.

After you have leiningen installed, run

`lein deps`

which will download all dependencies you need to run the clojure koans.


### Running The Koans

To run the koans, simply run

`run.sh`

or, on Windows,

`run.bat`

### Credits

These exercises were started by [Aaron Bedra](http://github.com/abedra) of
[Relevance, Inc.](http://github.com/relevance) in early 2010, as a learning
tool for newcomers to functional programming. Aaron's macro-fu makes these
koans extremely simple and fun to use, and to improve upon, and Relevance's
initiative

Using the [koans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koan) metaphor as a tool for
learning a programming language started with the
[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) by [EdgeCase](http://github.com/edgecase).
